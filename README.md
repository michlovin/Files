# slider-nav

This was definetly a learning expierence for the senior devs I do have some idea of what I would do better and improve on. two question I have are;
- How to hook up a json file to an html what is the proper import syntax, do i need to import a local server extension or just properly use JSON.stringify()

- slider function how do I properly use transition to make it appear like it is sliding

I know I need to add media queries to the css too, I was playing around with question 1 too much.

in the css I need to add media queries for retina display, small devices, and larger devices like the ipad/mac
